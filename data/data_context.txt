Temperature[C]      Air Temperature
Humidity[%]         Air Humidity
TVOC[ppb]           Total Volatile Organic Compounds; measured in parts per billion
eCO2[ppm]           co2 equivalent concentration; calculated from different values like TVCO
Raw H2              raw molecular hydrogen; not compensated (Bias, temperature, etc.)

Pressure[hPa]       Air Pressure
PM1.0               particulate matter size < 1.0 µm (PM1.0). 1.0 µm < 2.5 µm (PM2.5)
PM2.5               particulate matter size < 1.0 µm (PM1.0). 1.0 µm < 2.5 µm (PM2.5)
NC0.5               Number concentration of particulate matter. This differs from PM because NC gives the actual number of particles in the
NC1.0               Number concentration of particulate matter. This differs from PM because NC gives the actual number of particles in the
NC2.5               Number concentration of particulate matter. This differs from PM because NC gives the actual number of particles in the
